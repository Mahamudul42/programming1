## Expected Results Summary

### RTL Performance (cycles/second)
| Processor | Verilator | Bluesim | Ratio |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Piccolo   | ~1.25e6   | ~8.5e5  | 1.47  |
| Flute     | ~9.8e5    | ~7.2e5  | 1.36  |
| Toooba    | ~4.5e5    | ~3.2e5  | 1.41  |

### GEM5 Performance Trends
- **Large config**: Best CPI (~1.28)
- **Small config**: Worst CPI (~1.78)
- **Issue width**: Higher = better ILP
- **ROB size**: Larger = better performance

### ALU Testing
- **Expected**: All tests PASS
- **Coverage**: Arithmetic, logical, shift operations
- **Edge cases**: Zero inputs, overflow conditions

## Time Estimates
- Setup: 30 minutes
- RTL sims: 2-4 hours
- GEM5 sims: 3-6 hours
- ALU tests: 15 minutes
- Analysis: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 8-14 hours

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Disk Space**: Monitor scratch usage, clean regularly
2. **Compilation Errors**: Check tool versions and paths
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce parallel jobs (-j4 vs -j8)
4. **Network Issues**: Retry downloads if failed
5. **Simulation Hangs**: Check for infinite loops, kill and restart

## Final Notes
- Save all logs and results
- Backup important data to home directory
- Test report compilation before submission
- Submit only one PDF per team
