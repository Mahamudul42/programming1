## 🎯 **Three Ways to Execute**

### **Option 1: Ultra-Quick (Recommended)**
```bash
# Copy entire folder to CSELabs
scp -r /data/munna/all/programming1 hasan181@keller-lab.cs.umn.edu:~/

# SSH and run quick start
ssh hasan181@keller-lab.cs.umn.edu
cd ~/programming1
./INSTRUCTIONS/QUICK_START.sh
# Choose option 1 (tmux) to go home safely
```

### **Option 2: Step-by-Step**
```bash
# Follow detailed guide
cd ~/programming1/INSTRUCTIONS
cat STEP_BY_STEP_GUIDE.md
# Follow each step carefully
```

### **Option 3: Manual Execution**
```bash
# Run components individually
./setup_environment.sh
./run_rtl_simulations.sh  
./run_gem5_simulations.sh
./run_alu_tests.sh
./generate_pdf.sh
```

## ⏱️ **Timeline & Expectations**

| Phase | Duration | Your Time | Can Leave? |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Setup | 30 min | Active | No |
| RTL Sims | 2-4 hours | Monitor (optional) | **Yes** (with tmux) |
| GEM5 Sims | 3-6 hours | Away | **Yes** (with tmux) |
| ALU Tests | 15 min | Monitor | No |
| Analysis | 10 min | Active | No |
| **TOTAL** | **6-11 hours** | **1 hour active** | **Go home after setup!** |

---

## 🏠 **Go Home Strategy (tmux)**

```bash
# 1. Start assignment with tmux
cd ~/programming1
./INSTRUCTIONS/QUICK_START.sh
# Choose option 1

# 2. Detach safely: Ctrl+B, then D

# 3. Go home! Assignment runs overnight

# 4. Next day: Check results
ssh hasan181@keller-lab.cs.umn.edu
tmux attach -t assignment1
# Review completed results
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

**Your assignment is successful when:**

| Component | Success Indicator |
|-----------|------------------|
| **RTL** | 6 performance measurements with "cycles/second" data |
| **GEM5** | 4 CPI values for different configurations |
| **ALU** | "ALL TESTS PASSED" message |
| **Plots** | 2 PNG files with actual data (not placeholders) |
| **Report** | PDF with real experimental results |

## 🆘 **If Something Goes Wrong**

1. **Check**: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for your specific issue
2. **Verify**: `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` - did you skip anything?
3. **Restart**: Most issues are fixed by restarting the failed component
4. **Space**: 90% of issues are disk space - check `df -h`

---

## 📝 **Final Submission**

1. **Update Report**: Replace placeholder data with your real results
2. **Generate PDF**: `./generate_pdf.sh`
3. **Rename File**: `5204_Fall2025_ProgrammingAssignment1.pdf`
4. **Submit**: Upload to Canvas (only one team member!)
